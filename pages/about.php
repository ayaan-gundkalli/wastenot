                <p>At Waste Not, we believe no meal should go to waste when someone else could be fed.</p>
                
                <p>We're a community-focused platform built to connect those with surplus food — like restaurants, homes and events — with those in need, including NGOs, students, locals, and even animal caregivers. By enabling easy listing and sharing of food, we aim to reduce food waste right handed, and support sustainability — one meal at a time. Whether you're paying or receiving, Waste Not is here to make sure good food reaches the right hands.</p>
